===

This project studies impossible differential cryptanalysis on
substitution-permutation networks, specifically on AES.

### Outline of plan

1. Small scale attack - IDC on 5 round Mini-AES. *Bonus: 6 round Mini-AES*
2. IDC on 5 rounds of 48-bit SPN cipher. *Bonus: attack more rounds*
3. Either of the following:
    a. 64-bit SPN cipher, 5 or 6 round attack.
    b. 128-bit AES - compute distinguishers, key guess round extensions
